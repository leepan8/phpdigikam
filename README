Overview
========

This PHP application gives web access to your Digikam 1.x photo
collection.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------
You need a working apache webserver with PHP 5 installed.

Make sure PHP's safe_mode is disabled and your webserver has write
permission in the photos/ directory, otherwise PHP won't be able to
write files, and you'll have to do that manually.

PHP 4 will not work, as it cannot open SQLite databases (digikam saves
it's database in SQLite format) and it's Object-Syntax is different.
Feel free to adapt this script to PHP 4 though, should be easy, the
digikam database could be dumped into a mysql database.

Installation
------------
Put the unpacked archive somewhere in your htdocs or public_html folder
so apache can find it

 * Adapt inc/config.inc.php
 * Create a symlink under the phpdigikam folder named "images" pointing
   to your image collection (or add a corresponding DocumentRoot to
   Apache configuration).
 * Create a symlink under the phpdigikam folder named "thumbnails"
   pointing to your ~/.thumbnails/large folder
   (or add a corresponding DocumentRoot to Apache configuration).

   WARNING:
   You must make that directory and the thumbnails withing world-accessable.
   This is not the default since thumbnails are also created for your private
   documents and pictures. Chaning the default permissions can leak PRIVATE
   data!
     chmod 0701 ~/.thumbnails/large
     find  ~/.thumbnails/large -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} +

Go to
http://localhost/location-of-phpdigikam/albumview.php


About
=====

From Thorben:
This script was written to let others browse my photos and making use of
digikam's great tagging feature, which the ordinary HTML export didn't
offer.

It's very easy to use wget to get the functionality of the export plugin.

It works for me, but I realize this is neither very elegant nor very fast.
Feel free to improve it :-)

From Laurent:
I adapted it to my own needs and made it work with Digikam 1.x. I hope it
will work for you.
